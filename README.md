My first html project with Odin.

11/14/2021

This project will demonstrate what I have learned the intro to HTML section of Odin. I am not chasing time, but with my ADHD have taken approximately 2 weeks to get here. This is a feat! Previously I would have lost interest after day 3. 

I will be following the recipe instructions, however initially want to do basic automobile maintenance. New England weather be damned! It will be too cold to take photos of these procedures.
